# NovaVest Embedded – PiggyBank Prototype

This repo is a simple front-end prototype of **NovaVest Embedded**, an AI financial agent integrated into a fictional bank called **PiggyBank**.

It demonstrates two key experiences:

- `individual.html` – Individual retail customer view  
- `corporate.html` – Corporate treasury / mid-market company view  

Everything is static: **dummy data + simple JavaScript** to simulate NovaVest’s AI suggestions, guardrails, and scenario explanations.

## Files

- `index.html` – Landing page linking to both prototype views
- `individual.html` – Individual NovaVest dashboard
- `corporate.html` – Corporate NovaVest treasury dashboard

## How to run locally

Simply open the files in a browser:

- Double-click `index.html`, or
- Serve the folder with any static server (e.g. VS Code Live Server)

## GitHub Pages

If you enable GitHub Pages on this repo, your prototype will be publicly accessible at a URL like:

- `https://<your-username>.github.io/novavest-piggybank-prototype/`

Then you can open:

- `…/individual.html`
- `…/corporate.html`
